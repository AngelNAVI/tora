### User comments

<blockquote Red Hat IT>We just wanted to make sure you know how much we here in the Red Hat IT group appreciate TOra. It's an official departmental application for our Oracle developers for two main reasons - **It's licensed under the GPL** and **It's functionality meets or exceeds the abilities of any proprietary application we've seen**.
 
I've worked for Red Hat for three years and have been using Open Source tools for five, and in that time, TOra is definitely one of the most mature Open Source applications I've ever seen or used. Thank you for your important contributions to the Open Source community.

<blockquote Sourceforge.net users>"This is a very good alternative to Toad or Oracle PL/SQL Developer and it runs off a USB drive ala portable applicaton."

"I used to work with another tool, but since i found TOra I'be been using it successfully in dev and prod environments. Good job!"

"Great product, compares well with overpriced commercial products. Look forward to more functionalities, like visual query designer, being added."
